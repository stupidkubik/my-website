# Project Plan

## Core Track
- [x] Initialize git repository and create `dev` branch
- [x] Define project decisions (Systematic Minimalist + Stack A)
- [x] Scaffold Next.js Pages Router with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [x] Create base pages (Home, About, Projects, Project Detail, Contact, Resume, 404)
- [x] Add content from CV (copy, experience, links, project details)
- [x] Add demo and GitHub links for projects
- [x] Establish design tokens and typography scale
- [x] Add shared layout (Header/Footer) and navigation
- [x] Add UI primitives (Button, TextLink, ProjectCard, Badge, Section)
- [x] Add Grid system and apply to key layouts
- [x] Stabilize typography and copy consistency
- [x] Add modular rhythm with `Stack` and align spacing across pages
- [x] Add optional grid overlay (currently disabled)
- [x] Add extra-small breakpoint (`375px`) and tiny-screen adjustments
- [x] Lint passes

## Current Focus
- [x] Stabilize layouts and modular rhythm (final pass)
- [x] Decide on grid overlay treatment (keep off)

## Backlog
- [ ] Replace placeholders with project screenshots/media
- [ ] Implement downloadable neutral CV (PDF)
- [ ] Add SEO metadata (OG, canonical, sitemap, robots)
- [ ] Add accessibility pass (focus states, aria labels where needed)
- [ ] Consider subtle motion (page load/staggered reveals)
- [ ] Optional: dark mode after light theme is finalized
