# Evgenii Rubin — Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with Next.js (Pages Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind. The project follows the "Systematic Minimalist" concept and a fast Stack A setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- `npm run dev` uses Webpack explicitly to avoid the Turbopack WASM issue on macOS.
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Structure

- `src/pages` — Pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact, Resume)
- `src/components` — Layout and UI components
- `src/components/ui` — Design primitives (buttons, cards, layout helpers)
- `src/styles` — Global tokens and base styles
- `public/media` — Screenshots and media assets (currently placeholders)

## Content Sources

Project data and copy are aligned with the PDF materials (kept out of git). Screenshots are placeholders and will be replaced later.

## Plan

The active plan is tracked in `PLAN.md` with completed steps and backlog items.
